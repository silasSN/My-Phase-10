        <h1>Phase 10 Rules: Extreme</h1>
        <p class="extreme-par-bottom">The gameplay of this iteration is very different from the others. In order for you to play this mode, you will need this website handy for the whole game. As the rules got for turn to turn gameplay, they have not been changed, only the rules for the phases have been. Instead of having 10 set phases like in normal Phase 10, the first 9 are randomly picked each round, meaing that you could have the same phase more than once in a game. To start, change the "player 1" "player 2" and so on to names you want by click on it and typing in the new name, than click "New Phase" to get a phase for each player, and tell them their phase or make the screen visiable to all. After someone goes out add a point to that player and any other player who laid down, using the arrow keys on the right side of the number or us pen and paper to keep track of how many phases they complete. If you are playing by counting points do that now. Once you have added the phase number and added points you can pick one of the following 2 ways to play. </p>
        <li>#1: Only click the new phase button for those who laid down their cards and gained a point.</li>
        <li>#2: Click the new phase button for everyone including those who didn't lay down so that they get a differnt phase.</li>
        <p>Decide which way you will play and start the next round. Play till someone completes their 9th phase (their points should say 10 meaning they are on the 10th phase), Do not pick a new phase for that player, instead to make the end of the game more fair, they must play, lay down, and go out on the "Final Phase" in order to end the game. Once somone completes the last phase by laying down and going out, finish adding the points up and see who wins! If you wish you can place a "House Rule" on the game in which you can pick a phase(s) to not use, when it comes up just click the new phase button for another one. The possible phase are the following:</p>
        <li>3 sets of 3</li>
        <li>A run of 9</li>
        <li>9 cards of one color</li>
        <li>A run of 5 in one color</li>
        <li>2 sets of 5</li>
        <li>A run of 10</li>
        <li>5 sets of 2</li>
        <li>2 sets of 3 and a set of 4</li>
        <li>Set of 5 and a run of 4 in one color</li>
        <li>Set of 6 and a run of 3 in one color</li>
        <li>A run of 8</li>
        <li>A run of 11</li>
        <li>A run of 7 and a set of 4</li>
        <li>A run of 4 and a run of 4 in one color</li>
        <li>A run of 4 in different colors</li>
        <p class="bottom-par-extreme">If you have a phase suggest or want to remove a phase you can talk with me (if you know me) and we can talk about it :)</p>
